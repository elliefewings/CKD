## Setting-up environment

The environment will be set with a random seed number for
reproducibility and an output folder for processed data and figures.

### set env

``` r
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Seed number
set.seed(1234)
# Output directory
OUTDIR <- "./01_Seurat/"
if(!dir.exists(OUTDIR)) dir.create(OUTDIR);

# Figures
FIGDIR <- paste0(OUTDIR, "/figures/")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path=FIGDIR)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev=c('png','tiff'))
# Data
DATADIR <- paste0(OUTDIR, "/data/")
if(!dir.exists(DATADIR)) dir.create(DATADIR);
```

### Load libraries

Essential libraries for R analysis.

``` r
library("dplyr")
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

``` r
library("Seurat")
library("ggplot2")
```

## Load data

Individual samples are stored in individual folders in the
`./raw/scRNAseq`.

We first load the metadata of all samples.

``` r
meta <- read.table("./data/scRNAseq_metadata.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, quote = "")

# We create a dictionary of sampleID from raw to supplementary files
sID_dict <- setNames(meta$sampleID, meta$sampleID_suppl)
print(sID_dict)
```

And the metadata for individual cells

``` r

            stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# We recover the original SampleID

                paste0(sID_actual,"_"),
                meta2$cell)
}
cellOrigin <- sapply(meta2$cell, function(x) strsplit(x, split="_")[[1]][1])

# Fix one problematic sample ID
cellOrigin <- gsub("^KPMP", "KPMP_Pilot_18342", cellOrigin)

cellcluster_bySample <- split(setNames(meta2$cluster.name.abbreviation, meta2$cell),
                       cellOrigin)
