#### Summary:
Combined processing of 24 samples including 16 tumor-nephrectomy, 5 surveillance and 3 pre-perfusion 
biopsies using the scRNAseq protocol yielded 22,268 cells (4690 from surveillance biopsies, 16,491 
from tumor-nephrectomies and 2834 cells from pre-perfusion biopsies)

#### Metadata 
The metadata for individual samples were extracted from GEO via GEOquery. However, we are interested in
the metadata for the single cells. For this, we requested to the main authors of the manuscript the one
that they have been described in their publication. They send it to us via e-mail.
